# AI_summary_bot
The AI News Summarization Bot is a Telegram-native assistant that combats
information overload by condensing technology-focused news streams into bite-sized, per-
sonalised digests. A background scraper polls eight carefully-selected channels, parses
every incoming post and routes it through an ensemble of five statistical and machine-
learning models—Bayesian importance, false-discovery-rate filtering, logistic regression,
TF-IDF clustering and Z-score outlier detection—to rank real-time relevance. Only the
most pertinent items are cached.
At the user’s preferred cadence (daily, every three days or weekly) the bot compiles a
bulletin in the chosen interface language (English / Russian). Each headline arrives with
a two-sentence abstract generated by OpenAI GPT-4o. Should the reader tap “Learn
more", the system triggers a secondary SERP-augmented summarisation loop: it gathers

complete with source links.
All runtime settings—including language, frequency, and last-sent timestamp—are
persisted in lightweight JSON files, keeping infrastructure minimal during the MVP phase
while allowing seamless migration to PostgreSQL later on.
